Elgg QuasiAccess
================

### This is proof-of-concept. Abstain from using in product just yet.###

Allow access to multiple ACLs using metacollection entities and magic.

## To-Do ##
* Look at use case scenarios to determine whether or not metacollections need
to be rebuilt/reset when users and/or content are deleted
* Build actual ACLs when the plugin is deactivated
